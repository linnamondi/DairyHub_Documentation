 ### Interaction Flow for AI-powered Product Query in DairyHub

- **User Input:**  
  The farmer enters a query (typed or voice) via the mobile app’s chat-style interface.

- **Query Transmission:**  
  The app sends the input query securely to the backend API.

 **NLP Processing:**  
  The backend forwards the query to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, which interprets the query’s intent, extracts key information such as product names or concerns, and determines what information the farmer seeks.

 **Metadata Retrieval:**  
  Based on the extracted keywords/entities, the backend queries the product database to fetch structured metadata pertaining to the relevant product(s).

 **Answer Generation:**  
  The NLP model combines the retrieved metadata and natural language generation techniques to produce a clear, contextually appropriate, and informative response.

 **Response Delivery:**  
  The generated answer is sent back to the mobile app through the API and displayed in the conversational UI.

**Follow-up Handling:**  
  The system maintains conversational context to support follow-up queries, allowing the farmer to ask related questions without needing to repeat context.

### Implementation Considerations

 **NLP Model:**  
  Use a domain-adapted language model specialized in dairy/agriculture terminology.  
  Ensure it can perform intent recognition, entity extraction, and natural language generation grounded in structured product data.

**Database Design:**  
  Maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date product metadata database with fields such as:  
  - Product name  
  - Description  
  - Usage instructions  
  - Benefits  
  - Risks  
  Use indexes and flexible querying to ensure rapid data retrieval.

 **Mobile UI:**  
  Design a simple and intuitive chat-style interface for natural language input (text and possibly voice).  
  Display AI responses clearly, supporting multi-turn conversations and follow-ups.

 **Backend Infrastructure:**  
  Provide scalable, secure RESTful or GraphQL APIs connecting the mobile app to the NLP service and database.  
  Implement caching mechanisms for frequently asked questions to improve response time.  
  Enforce authentication, authorization, and data privacy best practices.
