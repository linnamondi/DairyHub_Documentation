**Sprint & Project Management at DairyHub**
Delivering the best experience for farmers and suppliers at DairyHub depends on structured, agile project management. Our workflow combines short iteration cycles, clear roles, and end-to-end traceability to ensure every feature is robust, user-centric, and delivered on time.

**Project Workflow**

**Central Tool:**
All work is organized, tracked, and reviewed using Jira. This enables clear visibility, streamlined communication, and real-time progress monitoring across the team.

**Sprint Cadence:**
Development proceeds in 1-week sprints. This tight feedback loop allows rapid iteration, continuous improvement, and the flexibility to address user needs as they evolve.

**Key Roles**

**Scrum Master:**
Facilitates sprint planning, daily check-ins, and retrospectives, ensuring smooth team collaboration and prompt resolution of obstacles.

**Backend Lead:**
Oversees all server-side development (Django), focusing on secure and efficient API design, business logic, and data architecture.

**Frontend Lead:**
Manages the implementation of user interfaces in React and Kotlin, collaborating closely with the designer for a seamless user journey.

**Designer:**
Crafts intuitive Figma mockups and UI flows to ensure every product update is clear, usable, and visually appealing.

**Feature Development Process**

Every DairyHub feature follows a structured, transparent workflow:

**Mockup Creation**
Designers prepare detailed Figma mockups, setting a clear visual and functional blueprint.

**API Specification**
Backend lead translates requirements into Django REST API endpoints and updates models as needed.

**Task Breakdown**
Scrum master creates and links Jira tasks covering all activities—each referencing the relevant mockups and API specs.

**Development & Testing**

Developers implement features in both backend and frontend.

Automated and manual tests are written for core processes and user flows.

**Quality Assurance**
All features are validated through test cases in Jira, focusing on key flows like login/auth, product search, order lifecycle, and AI query endpoints.

**Deployment**
Once tests pass, the feature is deployed—first to staging, then production. Each release is logged for traceability.

**Linked Deliverables**
For every feature, a clear chain is maintained:

Mockup (Figma)

API endpoint/spec

Jira Task
